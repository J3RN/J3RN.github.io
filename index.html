                    <p>
                        I am a software engineer specializing in web development. In December of 2016, I graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am self-motivated, and the vast majority of my projects during school were outside the classroom&mdash;evidence of which can be seen in the <a href="#projects">projects section</a>. Most of my work is with Ruby on Rails, but I like to try whatever new technology catches my attention. If you'd like to see some of my work, I recommend checking out <a href="https://github.com/j3rn">my GitHub page</a>.

                    <p>
                        My coursework for my Computer Science and Engineering degree included courses on the foundations of computer science, software development practices, operating systems, neural networks, and high performace computing. I also took courses on physics, calculus, and engineering practices.

                    <h3>Technical</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I mainly work with Ruby on Rails, I also have extensive knowledge of Ruby (<em>without</em> Rails), Javascript, jQuery, HTML, HAML, and various shell scripting languages (bash, fish, and zsh). Additionally, I have some experience with C, Go, Clojure, Rust, Python, and R. In my coursework I was taught Java and ANSI C.

                    <h4>(January 2017 - Present)</h4>
                    <p>
                        At MOBI, I help maintain and extend the monolithic Ruby on Rails application which drives the MOBI website. This consists of fixing bugs reported by users and adding new features&mdash;often at the behest of new clients. My favorite task is to refactor older code to make it cleaner and more efficient. The technologies I work with at this position are Ruby on Rails, Capistrano, Git, and GitHub.

                    <p>
                        At CoverMyMeds, I mostly worked on internal-facing security and infrastructure projects. In order to meet the strict security requirements necessary for a healthcare-focussed company, I wrote a Ruby gem that allowed all secrets (such as Rails' <code>secret_key_base</code> and partner API keys) to be removed from the repository and be managed instead by our server infrastructure.

                    <p>
                        I am currently a member of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indyrb/">indy.rb</a>. When I was still attending the Ohio State University in Columbus, I was the president of the <a href="http://cwdg.io">Collegiate Web Developers Group (CWDG)</a>, and an active member of the <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/">OSU Open Source Club (OSU OSC)</a>, the <a href="http://columbusrb.com">Columbus Ruby Brigade</a>, and the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/columbus-rs/">Columbus Rust Society</a>. I gave a talk at a session of Columbus Ruby Brigade, which can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POSMbOWb-U&t=10m0s">on YouTube</a>. Additionally, I volunteered at OSU events in order to support CWDG and OSU OSC.

                    <p>
                        My most actively maintained projects are <a href="https://j3rn.com/goe">Game of Evolution</a>, a genetic algorithm written in vanilla JavaScript; <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/minecraft-manager">Minecraft Manager</a>, a Ruby on Rails app to provision, image, and destroy DigitalOcean droplets; and <a href="https://github.com/J3RN/time-tracker">Time Tracker</a>, a Ruby on Rails app to help me manage my todo list.

                        Despite my professional work being mostly web-development focussed, I tinker with embedded systems. I have several personal projects in this field, the most notable of which are the Pigeon Autonomous Quadcopter Project, which is under slow but active development with code hosted <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/pigeon">on GitHub</a>, and Karen Power Control (formerly Karen, the Automated Coffee Maker), the code for which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/karen">Karen's GitHub page</a>. Lastly, in conjunction with the Pigeon Project, I have contributed to the <a href="https://www.i2cdevlib.com/">i2cdevlib</a> project by writing the Arduino library for the L3G4200D gyroscope.
