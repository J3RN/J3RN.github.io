                        Hello! My name is Jonathan Arnett, and I have been building applications for the web since 2010, when I was a sophomore in high school. In December of 2016, I graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> from 2014 to 2019, but more recently have been working with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>. If you'd like to see my latest work, I recommend checking out <a href="https://github.com/j3rn">my GitHub page</a>.

                    <p>
                        The coursework for my Computer Science and Engineering degree included courses on the foundations of computer science, software development practices, operating systems, neural networks, and high performace computing. In my coursework I was taught Java and ANSI C.

                    <p>
                        While I mainly work with Elixir and Phoenix applications, I also have extensive knowledge of Ruby (<em>with and without</em> Rails), JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, and various shell scripting languages (bash, fish, and zsh). I have worked extensively with relational databases (usually <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>), often optimizing queries and eliminating N+1s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I have some experience with Rust, Clojure, and Python.

                    <h4>(April 2019 – April 2020)</h4>
                    <p>
                        In this position, I lead projects to integrate with national chains, added and extended the functionality of a Phoenix application, and mentored junior developers&mdash;all within extremely limited timeframes. My small, partially-remote team owned the processes by which orders are placed into the system, and thus all our systems were mission-critical and held to a high level of technical excellence.

                    <p>
                        At CoverMyMeds, I contributed to new and legacy Ruby on Rails and Phoenix microservice applications, working within a diverse, distributed team. Additionally, I created a small tool used to load server configuration into applications that is now deployed as part of nearly every microservice. During my time at CoverMyMeds I became familiar with compliance, security, and risk-management processes.

                    <h4>(January 2017 - May 2018)</h4>
                    <p>
                        At MOBI, I helped maintain and extend the monolithic Ruby on Rails application that drives the MOBI SaaS platform. One of my favorite tasks at this position was to refactor older code to make it cleaner and more efficient, which eventually lead to my assignment to the Performance Team. As a Performance Team member, I analyzed metrics to prioritize and implement optimizations, frequently by modifying and extending PostgreSQL queries.

                    <p>
                        I am currently a member of <a href="https://www.columbuselixir.com/">Columbus Elixir</a>, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/columbus-rs/">Columbus Rust Society</a>, and a variety of other tech meetups. I gave a talk at a session of Columbus Ruby Brigade, which can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POSMbOWb-U&t=10m0s">on YouTube</a>. When I was still attending the Ohio State University, I was the president of the <a href="https://github.com/cwdg/">Collegiate Web Developers Group (CWDG)</a>, and an active member of the <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/">OSU Open Source Club (OSU OSC)</a>,  Additionally, I volunteered at OSU events in order to support CWDG and OSU OSC.

                    <p>
                        While in college, I maintained <a href="https://github.com/J3RN/time-tracker">Time Tracker</a>, a Ruby on Rails application to help me manage my todo list; <a href="https://github.com/J3RN/game-of-evolution">Game of Evolution</a>, a genetic algorithm written in vanilla JavaScript; and <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/minecraft-manager">Minecraft Manager</a>, a Ruby on Rails application to provision, image, and destroy DigitalOcean droplets.

                        Despite my professional work being mostly web-development focused, I like to tinker with embedded systems. I have several personal projects in this field, the most notable of which are the Pigeon Autonomous Quadcopter Project and <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/karen">Karen Power Control</a> (formerly Karen, the Automated Coffee Maker). Lastly, in conjunction with the Pigeon Project, I contributed to the <a href="https://www.i2cdevlib.com/">i2cdevlib</a> project by writing the <a href="https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/L3G4200D">Arduino library for the L3G4200D gyroscope</a>.
