            I am a software engineer specializing in web development. I recently graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (December 2016). I am self-motivated, and the vast majority of my projects during school were outside the classroom&mdash;evidence of which can be seen in the <a href="#projects">projects section</a>. Most of my work is with Ruby on Rails, but I like to try whatever new technology catches my attention. If you'd like to see some of my work, I recommend checking out my <a href="https://github.com/j3rn">GitHub page</a>.

            <h3>Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://mobiwm.com/">MOBI</a></h3>
            <h4>(May 2016 - August 2016)</h4>
            At this position, I helped maintain the monolithic Ruby on Rails application which drives the MOBI website. I also mentored the other interns as they learned Ruby on Rails. The technologies I worked with at this position were Ruby on Rails, Capistrano, Git, and GitHub.

            <h4>(May 2015 - December 2015)</h4>
            At CoverMyMeds, I mostly worked on internal-facing security and infrastructure projects. In order to meet the strict security requirements necessary for a healthcare-focussed company, I wrote a Ruby gem that allowed all secrets (such as Rails' <code>secret_key_base</code> and partner API keys) to be removed from the repository and be managed instead by our server infrastructure.

            <h3>Education (GPA: 3.367)</h3>
            My coursework for my Computer Science and Engineering degree included courses on the foundations of computer science, software development practices, operating systems, neural networks, and high performace computing. I also took courses on physics, calculus, and engineering practices.

            <h3>Technical</h3>
            While I mainly work with Ruby on Rails, I also have extensive knowledge of Ruby (naturally), Javascript (including jQuery), CSS (including SASS), and HTML (including HAML and Slim). Additionally, I have some experience with Go, Rust, PHP, Java, C/C++, Python, MATLAB, and R.

              <h3>Involvement</h3>
              I am currently a member of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indyrb/">indy.rb</a>. When I was still attending the Ohio State University in Columbus, I was the president of the <a href="http://cwdg.io">Collegiate Web Developers Group (CWDG)</a>, and an active member of the <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/">OSU Open Source Club (OSU OSC)</a>, the <a href="http://columbusrb.com">Columbus Ruby Brigade</a>, and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/columbus-rs/">Columbus Rust Society</a>. I gave a talk at a session of Columbus Ruby Brigade, which can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POSMbOWb-U&t=10m0s">on YouTube</a>. Additionally, I volunteered at OSU events in order to support CWDG and OSU OSC.

              <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>My most actively maintained projects are <a href="http://j3rn.com/goe">Game of Evolution</a>, a genetic algorithm written in vanilla JavaScript; <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/minecraft-manager">Minecraft Manager</a>, a Ruby on Rails app to provision, image, and destroy DigitalOcean droplets; and <a href="https://github.com/J3RN/time-tracker">Time Tracker</a>, a Ruby on Rails app to help me manage my todo list.</p>
	    <p>Despite my professional work being mostly web-development focussed, I tinker with embedded systems. I have several personal projects in this field, the most notable of which are the Pigeon Autonomous Quadcopter Project, which is under slow but active development with code hosted <a href="https://github.com/j3rn/pigeon">on GitHub</a>, and Karen Power Control (formerly Karen, the Automated Coffee Maker), the code for which can be found on <a href="http://github.com/j3rn/karen">Karen's GitHub page</a>. Lastly, in conjunction with the Pigeon Project, I have contributed to the <a href="http://www.i2cdevlib.com/">i2cdevlib</a> project by writing the Arduino library for the L3G4200D gyroscope.</p>
